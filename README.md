I created an innovative log analyzer for World of Warcraft using the WarcraftLogs API, React, and Bootstrap. This tool was designed to provide players with actionable insights by analyzing their gameplay data.

The WarcraftLogs API allowed me to access and process the intricate gameplay data. By utilizing React, I was able to create an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allowed players to interact with their game logs easily and efficiently. This also enabled me to design reusable components, manage the application's state effectively, and create dynamic and interactive UIs that provided a rich user experience.
